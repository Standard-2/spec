# `serde`

**SerDe** stands for **Serialization and Deserialization**. It refers to the process of:

- **Serialization**: Converting data into transmittable and formatted data.
- **Deserialization**: Converting formatted data into a usable data structure.

::: warning SerDe is **not** responsible for:

- **Compression** *(e.g., lz4, zlib)*
    - Use the [cede](<../CeDe/index.md>) library
- **Encoding** *(e.g., base64, hex)*
    - Use the [codec](<../Codec/index.md>) library
- **Cryptography** *(e.g., hashing, encryption)*
    - Use the [crypto](<../../runtime/Crypto/index.md>) library
:::

## Purpose

SerDe helps in the process of data persistence, mainly between the network boundary.

## Use Cases

- Saving configurable files
- Sending formatted data through the network boundary, mostly using API's.
- Saving parsable data to the disk
